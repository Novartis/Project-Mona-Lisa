Project Mona Lisa (PML): Machine-learning assisted Diagramming Platform

Project Mona-Lisa (PML) is a platform designed for users to create neat and organized diagrams without having to search for the objects you want. PML has a training mode to collect user data, to be trained in the machine learning layer. With a trained machine learning model, the user can then drag and resize objects to create their own custom diagram. PML has the potential to assist users in drawing anything from simple squares and arrows to molecules and lab equipment.
